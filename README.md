# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

This project involves loading, cleaning, and analyzing e-commerce data using PostgreSQL. The steps and instructions for completing the project are detailed in the `assignment.md` file.

## Project Structure

- `assignment.md`: Contains detailed instructions for each part of the project.
- `schema.png`: The ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for the database.
- `cleaning_data.md`: File containing SQL scripts for cleaning the data.
- `starting_with_questions.md`: The file for answering the project questions.
- `starting_with_data.md`: The file for answering new questions on the data.
- `qa.md`: The file to store the QA part of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL installed on your machine.
- pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client for database management.
- I used pgAdmin for coding and vs code for markdown.

### Instructions

1. **Loading CSV Files into Database**:
    - Create a new PostgreSQL database called `ecommerce`.
    - Set up tables for each CSV file by following the instructions in the `assignment.md` file.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Explore the data and identify any potential data issues.
    - Clean the data as instructed in the `assignment.md` file.

3. **Data Analysis**:
    - Perform data analysis by writing SQL queries.
    - Create views and ensure they are visible in the ERD.  
    - Create 3 new questions on the data.

4. **Generate ERD**:
    - Generate the ERD for the database using pgAdmin.
    - Save the ERD as `schema.png` and include it in the project.
